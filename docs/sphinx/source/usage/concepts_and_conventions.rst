Concepts and conventions
========================

Path conventions
----------------
FIRE makes use of a number of top level base paths that are substituted into path format strings in order to enable
easy customisation of input and output file locations.
The table below summarises these base paths:

.. list-table:: Input files
   :widths: 15 30 50
   :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Example/default
      - Descirption
    * - {air_repo_dir}
      - <where ever you clone the air repo>/air
      - This is the path to the air directory that is produced when you do git clone ....
    * - {air_repo_dir}
      - {air_repo_dir}/fire
      - This is the path `fire/` python source directory inside the cloned air directory
   * - {fire_user_dir}
     - ~/fire/
     - | Location for users input and output files.
       | Ideally not in the air source directory as it's contents is specific to the user.
       | * Contains the users fire_config.json file that specifies the values of other paths in this table.
       | * Can be set with `export FIRE_USER_DIR=<my_fire_user_directory_path>`
   * - {calib_dir}
     - "{fire_source_dir}/../../air_calib/"
     - Location of the cloned air_calib directory. If this is cloned from the same location the air repository was
     cloned, these files will be located using the default user_config.json settings
